## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is a premier platform for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a vast collection of problems that help developers enhance their algorithmic skills.

## Project Overview

This repository is a collaborative effort by [@matheusaudibert](https://github.com/matheusaudibert), [@caio-andres](https://github.com/caio-andres), and [@enzowxl](https://github.com/enzowxl). Our mission is to solve one LeetCode problem each day, documenting our solutions and explanations to foster learning and growth.

## Summary

Here you will find the summary of all the problems we have solved. Each problem is documented with its description, solution, and explanation.

To view the full summary of all exercises, simply access the [`summary.md`](problems/summary.md).

If you wish to filter problems by difficulty, you can check the following files:

- **Easy Problems**: [`easy.md`](problems/easy.md)
- **Medium Problems**: [`medium.md`](problems/medium.md)
- **Hard Problems**: [`hard.md`](problems/hard.md)

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory, containing:

- **description.md**: The problem statement.
- **explanation.md**: A detailed explanation of the approach and logic used.
- **solution.py**: The implemented solution in Python.
- **solution.xx**: The implemented solution in any other language.

## Multilingual Support

To cater to a broader audience, we provide documentation in both English and Portuguese. The structure for each problem is as follows:

```
├── problems
│   └── solutions
│       ├── 001-two-sum
│       │   ├── en/
│       │   │   ├── description.md
│       │   │   └── explanation.md
│       │   ├── pt/
│       │   │   ├── descricao.md
│       │   │   └── explicacao.md
│       │   ├── solution.py
│       │   └── solution.xx
│       │
│       └── 002-add-two-numbers
│           ├── en/
│           │   ├── description.md
│           │   └── explanation.md
│           ├── pt/
│           │   ├── descricao.md
│           │   └── explicacao.md
│           ├── solution.py
│           └── solution.xx
```

This format ensures consistency and makes it easy to navigate through the problems we've tackled in both languages.
