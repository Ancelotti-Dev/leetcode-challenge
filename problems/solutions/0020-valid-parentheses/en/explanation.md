# Validating Balanced Brackets Explained

Hey there! So this code is checking if a string has properly balanced brackets. You know, like when you're coding and need to make sure all your parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets are properly opened and closed in the right order.

Here's what's happening:

The function `isValid` takes a string as input and tells us whether the brackets in it are valid (returns `true`) or not (returns `false`).

We use a stack (basically a list where we only add/remove from one end) to keep track of the opening brackets we've seen. Every time we see an opening bracket - `(`, `{`, or `[` - we push it onto our stack.

When we come across a closing bracket - `)`, `}`, or `]` - we check if it matches the most recent opening bracket in our stack. If it does, great! We pop that opening bracket off the stack and continue. If not, or if the stack is empty (meaning we found a closing bracket without a matching opening one), we return `false` right away.

After going through the entire string, we do one final check: if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets were properly closed, so we return `true`. If there's anything left in the stack, it means some opening brackets never got closed, so we return `false`.

It's like making sure all your doors that you opened get closed properly before you leave the house!
