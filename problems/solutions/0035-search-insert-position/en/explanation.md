# 35. Search Insert Position - Solution Explanation

## Approach: Linear Search with Neighbor Check

This solution uses a linear search approach to find the correct position to insert a target value into a sorted array. It examines each element and its neighbor to determine the proper insertion point.

## Algorithm Logic:

1. We initialize a variable `finalIndex` to 0 (default position if all elements are greater than the target).
2. We iterate through each index of the array:
   - We convert the string index from `for...in` loop to a number.
   - We get the current element and its next element (which may be undefined if we're at the end).
3. We handle two main cases:
   - Case 1: If we find the exact match for the target, we record this index.
   - Case 2: If the target is greater than the current element, we check:
     - If the next element is greater than or equal to the target, OR
     - If there is no next element (we're at the end of the array)
     - Then the target should be inserted right after the current element.
4. We return the final determined index position.

## Example Step-by-Step:

Using example: `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 5`

1. Initialization:

   - `finalIndex = 0`

2. Iteration:

   - Index 0:
     - `currentNumber = 1`, `nextNumber = 3`
     - `1 < 5`, and `3 < 5`, so no update to finalIndex
   - Index 1:
     - `currentNumber = 3`, `nextNumber = 5`
     - `3 < 5`, and `5 >= 5`, so `finalIndex = 2`
   - Index 2:
     - `currentNumber = 5`, `nextNumber = 6`
     - `5 === 5`, so `finalIndex = 2` (exact match found)
   - Index 3:
     - `currentNumber = 6`, `nextNumber = undefined`
     - `6 > 5`, so no update to finalIndex

3. Return `finalIndex = 2`
